                        <div>
                            Head over to the <a href="/upcoming_matches" class="text-blue-700">upcoming matches</a> page (after making sure you have <a href="/auth/steam" class="text-blue-700">logged in with Steam</a>) and predict the outcomes of professional DPC matches! However, instead of simply
                            choosing whether or not a team would win, you need to also choose the probability that a team will win using the slider. But beware—the scoring system punishes overconfidence.

                        <div>
                            The scoring system uses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score" class="text-blue-700">Brier scores</a>, which is the same system that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-to-play-our-nfl-forecasting-game/" class="text-blue-700">FiveThirtyEight Game</a> uses.
                            Possible points from each game range from a gain of 25 points to a loss of 75 points, and is calculated using the formula
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <code>points = 25 - (([probability of team winning] - 100)^2 / 100)</code>
                        </div>
                        <div class="pt-2">
                            For example, let's say for the Team Liquid vs Nigma Galaxy match, you predict that Nigma Galaxy has a 73% chance of winning.
                            Then, if Nigma Galaxy does indeed win, you will gain 17.7 points! However, if Team Liquid wins, you will lose 28.3 points.
                            Nigma Galaxy did end up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/6371895283" class="text-blue-700">winning</a> the match 2-1, so you would've have gained 17.7 points.

                            Additionally, you will see the average guess for each match, and if you are logged into steam and have added a guess for the match, you will see that too. Finally, if the match is completed (not live), the average points and your points can be seen.

                            The number of picks with the correct chosen winner is shown in the Correct column and is used as a tiebreak if there is a tie in scores.
